                    <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>Growing up in a time in which technology was rapidly advancing I was always intrigued on how people made such intricate games or profiles on Myspace, Facebook, and etc. In the age of Myspace I became more curious about designing my own profile and so I asked an uncle of mine who designed their own profile. He taught me the mere basics but that sparked my interests in backend design. Now as an adult I wanted to delve deeper into those technologies to expand my own and others ideas.</p>
                        <p>I am one of those people that believes two heads is better than one. To collaborate with others for me is an opportunity to learn from others and visa-versa. In high school I took a course on engineering design and collaborated with many classmates for projects in which we would create layouts for pulley systems, homes, playgrounds and etc. I thoroughly enjoy team work and the opportunity to communicate with others to create elaborate projects that I myself would not have been able to think of. Having taken the opportunity to step into a new career in Engineering Immersion I will be able to quench my infatuation with creation and I can not be more excited.</p>
                        <p>Beyond web development, as mentioned above, I enjoy and have a knack for creativity so I put it into good use through my art projects that I give as gifts to family and friends. As of recent I have been learning digital art to go along with stories I write on my blog. Not only do I participate in arts & crafts but I am a big movie buff who enjoys traveling. I've traveled all over the United States with my family to pursue our goal of going to every place Peewee Herman has been to in all his movies. My family and I have also re-enacted one of the most iconic scene in Forrest Gump when he ends his epic run at Monument valley on Highway 163.</p>
